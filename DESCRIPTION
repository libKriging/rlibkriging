Description: Interface to 'libKriging' 'C++' library <https://github.com/libKriging> that should
    provide most standard Kriging / Gaussian process regression features
    (like in 'DiceKriging', 'kergp' or 'RobustGaSP' packages).
    'libKriging' relies on Armadillo linear algebra library (Apache 2 license) by Conrad Sanderson, 
    'lbfgsb_cpp' is a 'C++' port around by Pascal Have of 'lbfgsb' library (BSD-3 license) by 
    Ciyou Zhu, Richard Byrd, Jorge Nocedal and Jose Luis Morales used for hyperparameters optimization.
